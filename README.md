# Integration-Using-Romberg-Rule-Numerical-Method-Implementation-in-Python
This repository contains a Python implementation of the Romberg Rule for numerical integration. The code allows users to choose among different numerical methods, specifically Trapezoidal, Simpson's 1/3, and Simpson's 3/8, for integration of the function \( f(x) = x^3 + x^2 + x + 1 \).
